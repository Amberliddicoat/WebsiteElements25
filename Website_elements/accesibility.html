            <h2>Accessiblity</h2>
            <p> When making a website you must make sure your website is usable. This can be in many ways such as contrast, reasonable alt text for images, providing captions for videos and allowing keyboard navigation. These functions allow people with disabilities to use your website much easier and efficiently. </p>
          
            <p> Formal Definition of accessibility on a Website:</p>
             <p>Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections. </p>
