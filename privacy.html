            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p>The definition of online privacy is the level of privacy protection an individual has while connected to the Internet. It covers the amount of online security available for personal and financial data, communications, and preferences.</p>
            <p>Formal Definition of Privacy on a Website:</p>
            <p>Privacy on a website refers to the protection of personal information that is collected, used, disclosed, and stored by a website or its third-party service providers. This personal information includes any data that can identify an individual, such as name, address, email, phone number, and financial information. Protecting privacy on a website involves compliance with data protection laws and regulations, as well as the implementation of technical and organizational measures to ensure that personal information is kept confidential, secure, and used only for lawful purposes.</p>

                <h2>Relevent Implications:</h2>
            <img src="Image/SurferSilhouette_Extension.png" alt="Website Logo" class="logo">
<p>When building a website, it&#39;s important to consider the relevant implications that can
impact the site&#39;s success. These implications include the target audience, purpose of the
website, and website performance. Understanding the target audience helps in designing a
website that resonates with them and meets their needs. The purpose of the website
dictates the design, functionality, and content needed to achieve its goals. Optimising
website performance is also crucial for ensuring that visitors have a positive experience and
    are more likely to engage with the site.</p>
<p>Being aware of these relevant implications can help designers create a website that is user-
friendly, meets the needs of the target audience, and achieves its purpose. Designing a
website without considering these implications can result in a site that doesn&#39;t resonate
with visitors or meet their needs. Additionally, a poorly optimised site can lead to high
bounce rates and low engagement, affecting the site&#39;s success.</p>
